# Debugging Guide

When debugging Python code:

- Check for indentation and syntax errors first.
- Use print statements or logging to inspect variables.
- Use `pdb.set_trace()` to pause execution and inspect live values.
- Always test small parts of code before combining into a full script.

If using APIs, check API keys and network requests.
